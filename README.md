This project is oriented mainly towards design, a way for me to see if I can use 
all I have learned so far about HTML, CSS and design on a dashboard that contains
a lot of elements.

The sliding sidebar is position: absolute and z-index was adjusted. The sliding is 
applied with translateX() to avoid modifying any other element such as width or 
positioning. 

The rest of the document is layed out with Grid and Flexbox. 

The graphs use ChartJs CDN, the legend was removed and a title was added as paragraph 
at the top.

The logs are in a table, and the rows dynamically added with JS.
