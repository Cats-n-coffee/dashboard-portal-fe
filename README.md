This project is oriented mainly towards design, it is purely front end, mainly 
HTML and CSS.

The login page is only a design exercise, the actual form is not active. The 
Facebook and Google login buttons direct to the dashboard.

The sliding sidebar is position: absolute and z-index was adjusted. The sliding is 
applied with translateX() to avoid modifying any other element such as width or 
positioning. 

The rest of the document is layed out with Grid and Flexbox. 

The graphs use ChartJs CDN, the legend was removed and a title was added as paragraph 
at the top.

The logs are in a table, and the rows dynamically added with JS.
